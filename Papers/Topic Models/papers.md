## [0] TOPIC MODELS

David M. Blei, John D. Lafferty

Overview over the fundamentals, linkes to older papers. 
Introduction to LDA and how to calculate it (not important for me).
Introduction to CTM (Correlated Topic Model). Works similiar to LDA but also takes covariance between topics into account. Uses logistic normal distribution instead of dirichlet. Could be better, but is more computional expensive.
Introduction to DMT (dynamic topic model), models development of topics over time.


## [1] Latent Dirichlet Allocation

David M. Blei, Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan

Detailed introduction and explanation of LDA. Very deep into probabilistic math.
